**Day 1**: Introduction to Agents & Agentic Architecture

Learning Objective:
Explore the foundational concepts of AI agents, their defining characteristics, and how agentic architectures differ from traditional LLM applications, laying the groundwork for building intelligent, autonomous systems.

key Takeaways:

Kaggle Notebook:
1. Build my first agent using Gemini and ADK: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juliasuzuki/day-1-1-build-my-first-ai-agent) 
2. Build my first multi-agent systems using ADK: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juliasuzuki/day-1-2-build-my-first-multi-agent-systems) 

-----

**Day 2**: Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP

Learning Objective:
Dive into the world of tools, understanding how AI agents can "take action" by leveraging external functionalities and APIs, and explore the ease of discovering and using tools offered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Kaggle Notebooks:
1. Explore new ways to add tools to extend what your agents can do: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juliasuzuki/day-2-1-adding-agent-tools?scriptVersionId=279720593)
2. Explore best practices for tools, including using MCP and long-running operations: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juliasuzuki/day-2-2-agent-tools-best-practices?scriptVersionId=279723899) 

-----

**Day 3**: Context Engineering: Sessions, Memory Management

Learning Objective:
Explore how to build AI agents that can remember past interactions and maintain context. Learn how to implement short-term and long-term memory to create more robust agents capable of handling complex, multi-turn tasks.

Kaggle Notebooks:
1. Build stateful agents and perform context engineering: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juliasuzuki/day-3-1-agent-sessions?scriptVersionId=279993136)   
2. Explore how to use memory with your agent: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juliasuzuki/day-3-2-agent-memory?scriptVersionId=280072517)

-----

**Day 4**: Agent Quality: Observability, Logging, Tracing, Evaluation, Metrics

Learning Objective:
Learn to build robust and reliable AI agents by mastering the critical disciplines of evaluating and improving agents. This session will cover observability, logging, and tracing to provide visibility, alongside key metrics and evaluation strategies to optimize agent performance.

Kaggle Notebooks:
1. Implement observability to help you debug your agents: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juliasuzuki/day-4-1-agent-observability?scriptVersionId=280077707) 
2. Evaluate your agents: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juliasuzuki/day-4-2-agent-evaluation?scriptVersionId=280079694) 

-----

**Day 5**: Prototype to Production 

Learning Objective: 
Go beyond local testing and learn to deploy and scale AI agents for real-world use. This session will cover the best practices for deploying your agents so that others can use them, including how to create a truly multi-agent system with the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol.

Kaggle Notebooks:
1. Explore how to use A2A Protocol to have agents interact with each other: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juliasuzuki/day-5-1-agent2agent-communication?scriptVersionId=280082956) 
2. Deploy your agent to Agent Engine on Google Cloud: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juliasuzuki/day-5-2-agent-deployment?scriptVersionId=280086806)
